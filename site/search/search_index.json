By putting these rule in place, it means that people and organisations who are publishing data about the same thing, can use the same language to talk about the thing. This means that someone can read about the standard, and then use the data that is published to that standard. It makes it a lot easier to reuse data that has been published, and is especially useful for using data that is published by lots of different people, to make a bigger dataset with more coverage. What is the Open3R open data standard? \u00b6 This Open3R open data standard is a standard which describes information about Household Waste Recycling Centres, and other places to take waste for recycling and reuse, and is being designed to provide guidance to local authorities on publishing data about these places. Data such as opening times, the services that are offered by a HWRC, or location of bring-banks. A data standard makes data better for users, because it means that different publishers, with different data capture and publishing systems, can publish data in the same format. This means it is much easier to stick two publisher\u2019s datasets together. If everyone publishes their data to the standard, then it is theoretically possible to have a dataset that covers the whole of the UK. This dataset could then be used to power a Where\u2019s My Nearest Recycling Centre app, or support time-to-travel analyses for recycling centres. The standard is being developed according to the Open Stand principles of: Due process Broad consensus Transparency Balance Openness How is the standard being developed? \u00b6 Funded by the Open Data Institute, workshops with industry experts, developed over a few iterations. How to use the standard \u00b6 The documentation here provides the detail of how to publish data to the standard, and how to use data that has been published to the standard. At a very high level, the publishing flow is as follows: A local authority decides they want to publish HWRC data to the standard They populate the csv template provide here (or prepare one from scratch using the specified column names) They create a csv file or spatial file of areas served by each HWRC. They publish the csv file(s) and/or spatial files on their website OR They send the data to the custodian of the standard for publishing Let the custodian of the standard know that there is new data Then repeat these steps whenever there is a change to the data.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"1_Introduction/1_1_Introduction/#introduction","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"1_Introduction/1_1_Introduction/#what-is-an-open-data-standard","text":"An open data standard is a set of rules that describe the structure and components of an open data set.

This may be a Household Waste Recycling Centre, a bring bank, a take-back scheme, or other similar site/service Household waste recycling centres \u00b6 A HWRC is a staffed household waste recycling centre, and is a place where residents can take household waste to be recycled, treated or disposed of. Each local authority area has a legal responsibility to provide this service to residents, and the service is usually provided in multiple sites across the local authority area. HWRCs might be known by different names in different areas, or by different people. Some examples of this are: civic amenity (CA) sites community recycling centres (CRCs) household-waste and recycling centres (HWRCs) household-waste sorting sites (HWSSs) household recycling centres (HRCs) household re-use and recycling centres (HRRCs) household-waste recovery centres (HWRCs) re-use and recycling centres (RRCs) recycling and waste centres (RWCs) tips dumps Bring banks \u00b6 Bring banks are containers approved by the council for the removal and treatment of specifict types of household waste. Take-back \u00b6 A take-back scheme is a service provided by retailers whereby consumers can return goods to be recycled or otherwise disposed of. Owner \u00b6 HWRC \u00b6 The owner of a HWRC is usually the Local Authority that the site is located within. Owners have a legal responsibility to provide household recycling services to its residents. Other services \u00b6 The owner of bring banks and take-back schemes could be local authorities, private companies, not for profit organisations etc. The owner is the organisation responsible for maintaining and administering the site. Operators \u00b6 HWRC \u00b6 The operator of a HWRC is the organisation responsible for the day-to-day management of the site. This could be the local authority, a different local authority, a not-for-profit organisation, or a private company. Other services \u00b6 Operators are the organisations responsible for individual receptacles in a site, and could be the local authority, private companies, or not-for-profit organisations. Services offered \u00b6 Services offered vary at different sites. Some may offer electrical item recycling, for example, while others may not. It\u2019s important for residents to know which services are offered by waste and recycling sites in their local area, so that they can visit the correct one depending on the material they have to recycle. Area served \u00b6 Each HWRC has a specific catchment area - and only residents who live within that catchment area are permitted to use the facility. Usually these catchment areas are as simple as a local authority, or a collection of local authorities, but there are circumstances where residents from a particular part of one local authority are permitted to use a HWRC in a neighbouring local authority. Transport Restrictions \u00b6 An HWRC might have different conditions for permits, bookings, opening hours, height, weight, etc. for different transport types. For example, a small vehicle might only be permitted to visit a site on a Monday but does not need a permit; however, a large vehicle might only be permitted to visit a site on a Tuesday and cannot come without a permit.","title":"Key Concepts"},{"location":"2_Key_Concepts/2_1_Key_Concepts/#key-concepts","text":"","title":"Key Concepts"},{"location":"2_Key_Concepts/2_1_Key_Concepts/#household-waste","text":"Household waste is waste that is generated by a household","title":"Household waste"},{"location":"2_Key_Concepts/2_1_Key_Concepts/#waste-and-recycling-site","text":"This is a place where members of the public can take their waste to be recycled, treated, or disposed of.

In the context of Open3R, there are difference ways of talking about various things. A member of the public may refer to a particular HWRC as \u2018Carrington tip\u2019, but a local authority waste officer may know it as \u2018Woodhouse Lane Recycling Centre\u2019. In a database it may be recorded as \u2018Woodhouse Ln Rec Ctre\u2019. While these all talk about the same thing, it could be hard for a human to know that they are the same, and pretty much impossible for a computer. To help get around this, we use identifiers. These are codes that we use to unambiguously reference a particular thing in our database. These identifiers must be unique, and to make sure of this, there are a few tricks we can use when deciding on an identifier. The main one is, wherever possible, to use an identifier from another source. An example of this would be for operators of HWRCs, who are companies, and therefore have entries in the Companies House database. By using the Companies House identifier for these operators, we can be certain the code is unique, and we know that we can join together different local authorities datasets to analyse which companies operate sites across the country. A bonus here is that usine the Companies House ID means an analyst can access additional information about the operator using the Companies House API, such as the date that the company was incorporated, or its filing history. Some identifiers are linked to the controlled lists, and again these can used to look up additional information about a thing - Local Authorities being one example. These are the identifiers that are proposed for this standard Recycling and waste site identifier \u00b6 Each RWS needs a unique identifier, and this should be created by the publishing organisation. Usually, publishing organisations will already have identifiers for the RWSs for which it is responsible. These are likely to be in use in CRM systems, waste management systems, or other databases. Although these identifiers are likely to be unique within the publishing organisation, there is a risk that two publishing organisations may use the same identifier for two different RWSs. To avoid this issue, the identifier is prefixed with the publishing organisation\u2019s unique identifier. To construct the identifier follow these steps: Start with the text open3r- . This means the identifier relates to the Open3R standard. Add the code from the RWS type controlled list. Eg for Housewold Waste Recycling Centres, this would be hwrc- Add the three letter code of the country that the owner is in: England: eng- Scotland: sct- Wales: pla- Northern Ireland: nir- Add the three letter code for the owner from the local authorities controlled list Add your organisation\u2019s unique identifier for the RWS As an example, if Trafford local authority has the unique identifier 1234 for Woodhouse Lane Recycling Centre, then the unique identifier for that site in this standard would be open3r-hwrc-eng-trf-1234 If the HWRC is a mobile tip and changes locations, the standard can accommodate this by adding a location tag to the above identifier. Add loc and a unique number As an example, if Trafford local authority has the unique identifier 1234 for Woodhouse Lane Recycling Centre which changes location, then the unique identifier for one site in this standard would be open3r-hwrc-eng-trf-1234-loc1 and the next site would be open3r-hwrc-eng-trf-1234-loc2 . Local Authority Identifiers \u00b6 Local Authority identifiers should be constructed in the following way: Start with the text \u2018open3r-localauth-\u2018 Add the three letter code of the country that the local authority is in: England: eng- Scotland: sct- Wales: pla- Northern Ireland: nir- Add the three letter code from the local authorities controlled list For example, the code for Trafford would be open3r-localauth-eng-trf Area Served \u00b6 When providing separate information about the area served by a HWRC, the identifier should be constructed in the following way: Start with the prefix open3r-area- Add the three letter code of the country that the owner is in: England: eng- Scotland: sct- Wales: pla- Northern Ireland: nir- Add the three letter code for the owner from the local authorities controlled list Add a unique code to differentiate this area from others that your organisation might publish As an example, if Trafford published data about the area served by Woodhouse Lane Recycling Centre, they would use the identifier open3r-area-eng-trf-a001 Operator identifiers \u00b6 Using common identifiers for RWS operators will enable analysis of aggregated data, such counting sites by operator across the country. Where the operator is a limited company, then the Companies House identifier should be used. Transport Restrictions \u00b6 When providing separate information about the transport restrictions by a HWRC, the identifier should be constructed in the following way: Start with the prefix open3r-trans- Add the three letter code of the country that the owner is in: England: eng- Scotland: sct- Wales: pla- Northern Ireland: nir- Add the three letter code for the owner from the local authorities controlled list Add your organisation\u2019s unique identifier for the HWRC Add a unique code to differentiate this area from others that your organisation might publish As an example, if Trafford published data about the transport restrictions, small vehicle by Woodhouse Lane Recycling Centre, they would use the identifier open3r-trans-eng-trf-1234t001","title":"Identifiers"},{"location":"5_Identifiers/5_1_Identifiers/#identifiers","text":"Identifiers are the way that humans and machines can know that a particular thing is definitely that thing.
